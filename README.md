##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform a **sales performance analysis** on a fictional dataset that contains 120 records of sales transactions across multiple regions and product categories.

We explore:
- Total and regional sales
- Profitability by category
- Best-selling products
- Monthly sales trends
- Correlation between quantity, sales, and profit
